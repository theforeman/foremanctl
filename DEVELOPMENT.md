# Development

## Requirements

### For Virtual Machine Development
* Vagrant - 2.2+
* Ansible - 2.14+
* [Vagrant Libvirt provider plugin](https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt)
* Virtualization enabled in BIOS

Follow [instruction](https://github.com/theforeman/forklift/blob/master/docs/vagrant.md) to install vagrant

### For Container Development (Alternative)
* Podman - 5.0+ (recommended for systemd support)
* Ansible - 2.14+

## Development environment

To setup the environment, run the setup script which will create a virtualenv and populate all of the dependencies:

```
./setup-environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Deployment

### Using Virtual Machines

This setup uses Vagrant to create a basic VM for running the deployment on:

```
./setup-environment
source .venv/bin/activate
./forge vms start
./foremanctl deploy --foreman-initial-admin-password=changeme
```

### Using Containers (Alternative)

As an alternative to VMs, you can use containers for faster deployment and testing:

```
./setup-environment
source .venv/bin/activate
./forge containers start
./foremanctl deploy --foreman-initial-admin-password=changeme
```

The containers command provides the following benefits:
- **Faster startup** - No VM boot time required
- **Lower resource usage** - Containers use less memory and CPU than VMs
- **Systemd support** - Properly configured systemd environment for service management
- **Port mapping** - Services accessible on host ports 8080 (HTTP) and 8443 (HTTPS)

Container management commands:
```
./forge containers start    # Start container (default name: quadlet)
./forge containers status   # Check container status
./forge containers stop     # Stop and remove container
```

You can also specify a custom container name:
```
./forge containers start mycontainer
```

## Deploy hammer (optional)

```
./forge setup-repositories
./foremanctl setup-hammer
```
To teardown the environment:

**For VMs:**
```
./forge vms stop
```

**For containers:**
```
./forge containers stop
```

## Testing

Ensure you have a deployment. Now run the tests:

```
./forge test
```

> [!NOTE]
> This will trigger all the tests so hammer tests will fail if you don't have [hammer setup](#deploy-hammeroptional)

Additonally, you can run [smoker](https://github.com/theforeman/smoker) based tests with:

```
./forge smoker
```

## Service Configuration

Configuration files for services are stored as [podman secrets](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-secret-create.1.html) and mounted into the container at the expected locations. These configuration files can be listed:

```
podman secret ls
```

To view an individual configuration file:

```
podman secret inspect --showsecret --format "{{.SecretData}}" <secret-name>
```

### Naming Convention

Each secret, whether a configuration file or value shall following the following conventions:

Naming:

    * Config files: <role_namespace>-<filename>-<extension>
    * Strings: <role_namespace>-<descriptive_name>

Naming when additional application context is required that does not match the `role_namespace`:

    * Config files: <role_namespace>-<app>-<filename>-<extension>
    * Strings: <role_namespace>-<app>-<descriptive_name>

Each shall contain labels that provide additional metadata:

    * Config Files
        - filename: <name of file>.<extension>
        - app: <name of application that uses the configuration file>
    * Strings:
        - app: <name of application that uses the string>
