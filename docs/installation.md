# Installation Design

## Installation Paths

### Happy Path

The installer should aim to support a minimal happy path for default deployment.

  1. Configure packaging repository
  2. Install installer package
  3. Run installer

### Advanced Path

The installer should support advanced installation paths that allow users to optimize and manage the procedure in more detail.
For example, pre-pulling images to reduce the core installer runtime.

  1. Configure RPM repository
  2. Install installer RPM
  3. Pull images
  4. Generate certificates
  5. Execute pre-requisite checks
  6. Run installer
  7. Post install checks

### Authenticated Registry Handling

In the non-default case where the image sources are supplied from an authenticated location users will need to inject a login step.
For example, users might be consuming a custom build of the Foreman image.

In this case, the happy path becomes:

  1. Configure RPM repository
  2. Install installer RPM
  3. Run installer and provide registry username and token

The advanced path breaks down to:

  1. Configure RPM repository
  2. Install installer RPM
  3. Login to registry with podman
  3. Pull images
  4. Generate certificates
  5. Execute pre-requisite checks
  6. Run installer
  7. Post install checks

## Installater Stages

The installer will have internal execution stages.
Some of the stages will be made available to the user to run independently.

  1. Accept input parameters
  2. Validate input parameters
  3. Execute pre-requisite checks
    a. system requirements
    b. tuning requirements
    c. certificate requirements
  4. Place `.container` files
  5. Create podman secrets
  6. Reload systemd
  7. (re)start services
  8. Execute post installation checks
  9. Post installation message

## Configuration Handling

When defining how a service will handle configuration there are best practices in design that should be followed.
The best practices are listed in preferential order.

  1. Use native environment variables
  2. Rely on envsubst with default config files in the container
  3. Mount config file from secrets
