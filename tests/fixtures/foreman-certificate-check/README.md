# Generate Certificates

To generate a new set of certificates:

```
./create_certs.sh
```

In order to modify properties of the certificates, edit the `extensions.txt` before re-generating.

To regenerate a particular set of certificates, remove them from the `certs/` directory and re-run the generation script.
